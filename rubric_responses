1) How does the Prophet Algorithm differ from an LSTM?
   According to https://neptune.ai/blog/arima-vs-prophet-vs-lstm Prophet algorithm is more similar to time series 
   because there is a stationary component, seasonality term identifying temporary patterns, holiday factor, and error in this algorithm. 
   This is different compared to Long-Short-Term-Memory models in which important features are selected and remembered.
   
   Why does an LSTM have poor performance against ARIMA and Profit for Time Series?
   According to https://neptune.ai/blog/arima-vs-prophet-vs-lstm LSTM is not as accurate in stock price prediction because it overfits.
   ARIMA and Prophet are probably better at accurately predicting stock prices or anything that varies by time.
   This might be because they incorporate time series-type methods instead of a model that selectively identifies relevant features.
   LSTM might be better at analyzing audio files or interpreting languages instead of predicting volatility of stock prices.

2) What is exponential smoothing and why is it used in Time Series Forecasting?
    Exponential smoothing in time series is when a recurrent moving average is taken to 'smooth' volatility in a given time period.

3) What is stationarity? What is seasonality? Why Is Stationarity Important in Time Series Forecasting?
    Stationarity is the pattern without seaonality. 
    Stationarity is the prediction in absence of seaonal variation. 
    It is usually the main signal researchers are interested in identifying.

4) How is seasonality different from cyclicality? Fill in the blanks:
    Seaonality is predictable, whereas cyclicality is not.
